# IPFS_Project
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.

added a file to IPFS, file is split into smaller chunks, cryptographically hashed, and given a unique fingerprint called a content identifier (CID).

This CID acts as a permanent record of your file as it exists at that point in time.
